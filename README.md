*Authors: Eric Osband eo255, Isuru Herath ish9, Aashri Aggarwal aia56*

This repository serves as a codebase used to generate the figures and results of our paper, *Uncertainty in Single-Cell Lineage Tracing Parsimony Methods for Cancer Metastasis*.

## Usage
The primary notebook from our analysis is `Infer Transition Matrices with Uncertainty`. For ease of use, we have included the original notebooks by Quinn et al. that we used as guides under the directory `./Original MetastasisTracing Notebooks/` and the Cassiopeia tree construction suite under `./Cassiopeia/`. The data we use was generated by Quinn et al. and was downloded from the Gene Expression Omnibus. See below.

## Data
Data generated by Quinn et al. and used here was downloaded from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE161363
